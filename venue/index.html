  <h2>Congress and Conference Centre: Centro Cultural de Belém</h2>
  <p>Situated between the Jerónimos Monastery and the Belém Tower, the Meeting Centre of the Centro Cultural de Belém is an ideal space for holding all types of institutional, corporate, scientific, commercial, cultural and social events.

    Located in the west of Lisbon, overlooking the Tagus river and harmoniously into its architectural surroundings, dominated by the splendid Jerónimos Monastery, and with the Belém Tower just a stone’s throw away, the Centro Cultural de Belém is a historical meeting point in Lisbon, designed to be just a small part of the city both in terms of its geography and in its relationship with the river.</p>

    <p>Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT) techniques are essential for software quality but can be challenging for novices. To bridge this gap, various strategies like training courses, on-the-job learning, coding clubs, and online resources are helpful. On the flip side, SBFT can benefit educators too.
SBFT-Ed unites educators from academia and industry worldwide to exchange knowledge on training new software testers in SBFT and leveraging SBFT in computer science education. We invite you to explore innovative strategies combining SBFT and education with us.</p>
